                                    <p>“The wife of the minister of the Gospel can be a most successful helper and a great blessing to her husband or a hindrance to him in his work”. It will depend on the wife if a minister will rise from day to day in his sphere of usefulness or sink to the ordinary level.
                                    <p> “Satan is ever at work to dishearten and lead astray ministers whom God has chosen to preach the truth. The most effectual way in which he can work is through home influences, through the wife of the Pastor”  It is therefore necessary to emphasize the importance of pastors’ wives and the impact they have on the pastor’s work.</p>

                        <p><strong> Acts 9:36</strong> In the city of Joppa there was a follower named Tabitha (whose Greek name was Dorcas). She was always doing good deeds and kind acts.</p>

                        <h3>Tabitha Ministry</h3>
                        <p>Tabitha Ministry is a department of the Good News Fellowship International that aims to help the widowed, orphans and the very poor members of society through providing food, offering guidance and counselling, holding spiritual services and moral support.</p>
                        <p>The Tabitha Ministry aims to pursue the lost with the gospel of Jesus Christ. We share the healing message of the cross with the broken lives as we interact with them. </p>
                        <p>The ministry requires commitment, prayers and God's divine provision, sacrifice and joining of purpose as we aim to share hope with all people that are going through tough times. Several of them are single mothers who have suffered intense abuse. Some are addicts. A handful of our contacts live in slums.</p>
                        <p>Although Tabitha Ministry experiences many challenges, and although the sin and brokenness of this world often make this ministry uncomfortable and challenging, we praise God that he uses our efforts to provide for others’ needs and to spread the gospel which radically changes and redeems.</p>
